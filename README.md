The Bank Management System is a software for maintaining a person's account in a bank. In this project, we showed the working model of bank system and its many functionalities. The aim is creating a Bank Management System. This helps the bank employees to make all the transitions very fast instead of recording it manually. We have used PHP as back-end, HTML as front-end, CSS and Bootstrap for styling and MySQL as database connection.
We have also made a credit card fraud detection in our bank system. The credit card system is a boom in online money transfer. Almost all the businesses are moving towards online money transaction to reach wide range of customers. This will greatly increase the profit of all the business. But it has some downsides too. This technology is prone to hacking and stealing. So, it is a must for business to check if the customerâ€™s credit card is real or not. So, we used SOM algorithm and ANN algorithm to check if the credit card is fraud or not.
